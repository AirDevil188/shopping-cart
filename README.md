# shopping-cart


Shopping Cart project as a part of "The Odin Project" curriculum. This is just a mock of a shopping page that includes products that are being fetched from [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/) Built with `Vite` `JavasCript`, `React`, `Styled Components` and with a help of `React Router` library for routing. It has, features like adding products to cart, searching them by `name` or by `category`. Cart page has functionality of increasing quantity of products that are in it and also an option to delete products from the cart with subtotal of prices. Also, I've used `localStorage` so that the products that are in the cart get's saved if the user exits out of the page/browser. Used `Vitest` with `React Testing Library` for testing.

It's fully responsive for smaller screens.
